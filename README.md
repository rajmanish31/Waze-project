# Waze Project
This end to end course project is part of Google Advanced Data Analytics course on coursera.

## Project goal:
Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

## Background:
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer.

## Scenario:
You are the newest member of Waze’s data team. Your team is about to begin their user churn project. The first step is to create a project proposal. The proposal will clearly define the overall goal of the project, and identify key tasks, milestones, and stakeholders. 

This project is done in several steps:

### Step 1: Inspect and analyze data
In this step, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Understand the situation
* Prepare to understand and organize the provided [waze dataset](https://github.com/rajmanish31/Waze-project/blob/main/Data/waze_dataset.csv) and information.

#### Part 2: Understand the data
* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.
* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps.

#### Part 3: Understand the variables
* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into specific variables.

### Step 2: Exploratory data analysis
In this step, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.

This step has 4 parts:

#### Part 1: Imports, links, and loading

####  Part 2: Data Exploration
* Data cleaning

#### Part 3: Building visualizations

#### Part 4: Evaluate and share results

### Step 3: Data exploration and hypothesis testing
In this step, you will explore the data provided and conduct a hypothesis test.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Imports and data loading
* What data packages will be necessary for hypothesis testing?

#### Part 2: Conduct hypothesis testing
* How did computing descriptive statistics help you analyze your data?
* How did you formulate your null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?

#### Part 3: Communicate insights with stakeholders
* What key business insight(s) emerged from your A/B test?
* What business recommendations do you propose based on your results?

### Step 4: Regression modeling
In this step, you will build a logistic regression model in Python. Logistic regression helps you estimate the probability of an outcome.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions
* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a binomial logistic regression model?

#### Part 2: Model Building and evaluation
* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?

#### Part 3: Interpreting Model Results
* What key insights emerged from your model(s)?
* What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?

### Step 5: Classifying videos using machine learning
In this step, you will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Ethical considerations
* Consider the ethical implications of the request
* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

#### Part 2: Feature engineering
* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

#### Part 3: Modeling
* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
